I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Williams College](https://csci.williams.edu/). I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Northeastern University in 2024, advised by [Michelle Borkin](khoury.northeastern.edu/people/michelle-borkin/). My research is focused on digital accessibility across a range of abilities within interactive and immersive technology. Some of my recent projects have centered on assistive technology for people with photosensitive epilepsy (in domains such as [virtual reality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3613904.3642635), [data visualizations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9904428/), and [social media](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445510)) and evaluating techniques for producing [3D printed braille](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642719) with people who are blind/low vision.
