excerpt: 'Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a low-cost method of 3D printing that is used to produce tactile graphics and interfaces for people with visual impairments. Orientation is known to impact the structure and quality of 3D-printed braille and text, but the relationship between print orientation and user comfort has not been empirically examined. We conducted two mixed-methods studies to evaluate the performance of braille printed at different angles in terms of reading time and subjective preference. Participants were faster and preferred reading braille printed vertically or at a high degree (e.g., 75Â°) over horizontally printed braille.'
