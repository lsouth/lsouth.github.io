excerpt: 'Replication studies are crucial to strengthening the data visualization field and ensuring its foundations are solid and methods accurate. Although visualization researchers acknowledge the epistemological significance of replications and their necessity to establish trust and reliability, the field has made little progress to support the publication of such studies and, importantly, provide methods to the community to encourage replications. Therefore, we contribute Vis Repligogy, a novel framework to systematically incorporate replications within visualization course curricula that not only teaches students replication and evaluation methodologies but also results in executed replication studies to validate prior work.'
